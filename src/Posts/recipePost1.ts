# Classic Spaghetti Carbonara

*June 1, 2022 by [Chef Sorin](/)*

Spaghetti carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that's beloved for its simplicity and rich flavor. Made with just a few key ingredients, it's perfect for a cozy night in or a special dinner with loved ones. Here's how to make it:

### Ingredients:

- 8 ounces spaghetti
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 8 slices pancetta or bacon, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

### Instructions:

1. Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and set aside.

2. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

3. In a large skillet, cook the chopped pancetta or bacon over medium heat until crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.

4. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and garlic. Toss to combine.

5. Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour the egg and Parmesan mixture over the hot pasta. Toss everything together quickly to coat the pasta in the creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water to thin it out.

6. Serve the spaghetti carbonara immediately, garnished with freshly chopped parsley and additional grated Parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy!

This classic spaghetti carbonara recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household. Its rich, creamy sauce and savory pancetta make it a comforting and satisfying meal that's perfect for any occasion.
