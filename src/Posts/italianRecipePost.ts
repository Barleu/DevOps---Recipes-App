*June 10, 2022 by [Chef Vito](/)*

#### Ingredients:

- 1 pizza dough ball (store-bought or homemade)
- 1/2 cup marinara sauce
- 1 cup fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
- 1-2 ripe tomatoes, thinly sliced
- Fresh basil leaves
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

#### Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to its highest temperature (usually around 500Â°F or as high as it will go). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.

2. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased pizza pan or parchment paper.

3. Spread the marinara sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Arrange the sliced mozzarella cheese and tomato slices on top of the sauce.

4. Drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil over the pizza, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.

6. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.

7. Slice the Margherita pizza into wedges and serve hot. Enjoy!

This classic Margherita pizza is a timeless favorite for a reason. With its simple yet flavorful combination of ingredients, it's a delicious taste of Italy that's sure to satisfy your cravings.
