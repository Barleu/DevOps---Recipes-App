*June 15, 2022 by [Chef Rikki](/)*

#### Ingredients:

- 2 cups cooked jasmine rice, chilled
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 cup mixed vegetables (such as carrots, peas, and corn)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- Salt and pepper, to taste

#### Instructions:

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the beaten eggs and scramble until cooked through. Remove the eggs from the skillet and set aside.
   
2. In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the mixed vegetables and minced garlic, and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.

3. Add the chilled cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps with a spoon. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, until the rice is heated through and starting to brown slightly.

4. Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet, along with the sliced green onions, soy sauce, and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine and coat everything evenly.

5. Season the fried rice with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until everything is heated through.

6. Serve the Chinese fried rice hot, garnished with additional sliced green onions if desired. Enjoy!
