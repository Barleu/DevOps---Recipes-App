*June 5, 2022 by [Chef Juan](/)*

**Ingredients:**

- 1 lb skirt steak or flank steak, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Corn tortillas
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Onion, finely chopped
- Salsa verde or pico de gallo
- Lime wedges

**Instructions:**

1. In a bowl, combine the sliced steak with the minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat the meat evenly.
2. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned steak slices to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness.
3. Remove the cooked steak from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it into bite-sized pieces.
4. Heat the corn tortillas in a dry skillet or directly over an open flame until warm and slightly charred.
5. Assemble the tacos by placing some sliced steak onto each tortilla. Top with chopped cilantro, onion, and salsa verde or pico de gallo.
6. Serve the tacos with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the top. Enjoy immediately!

These spicy Mexican street tacos are perfect for a casual dinner or a festive celebration. They're easy to make and bursting with flavor, making them a hit with everyone at the table.
